 * Any local variable used but not declared in an inner class must be definitely
 * assigned (ยง16) before the body of the inner class.
 * A blank final (ยง4.12.4) field of a lexically enclosing class may not be assigned
 * within an inner class, or a compile-time error occurs.
 * <p>
 * The declaration of class LocalInStaticContext occurs in a static context due to being
 * within the static method classMethod. Instance variables of class Outer are not available
 * within the body of a static method. In particular, instance variables of Outer are not
 * available inside the body of LocalInStaticContext. However, local variables from the
 * surrounding method may be referred to without error (provided they are marked final).
