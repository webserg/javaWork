 *
 * Suppose that we are given a sequence of pairs of integers, where each integer represents an object of some type and we are to
 * interpret the pair p-q as meaning "p is connected to q." We assume the relation "is connected to" to be transitive:
 * If p is connected to q, and q is connected to r, then p is connected to r. Our goal is to write a program to filter out
 * extraneous pairs from the set: When the program inputs a pair p-q, it should output the pair only if the pairs it has seen
 * to that point do not imply that p is connected to q.
 * If the previous pairs do imply that p is connected to q, then the program should ignore p-q and should proceed to input the next pair
 *
 *It is an implementation of a simple algorithm called the quick-find algorithm that solves the connectivity problem
 *  The basis of this algorithm is an array
 * of integers with the property that p and q are connected if and only if the pth and qth array entries are equal.
 * We initialize the ith array entry to i for 0  i < N. To implement the union operation for p and q, we go through the array,
 * changing all the entries with the same name as p to have the same name as q. This choice is arbitraryâ€”we could have decided
 * to change all the entries with the same name as q to have the same name as p.
