/**
 * Consider the following program, which reads the words from a dictionary file
 * and prints all the anagram groups whose size meets a user-specified minimum.
 * Recall that two words are anagrams if they consist of the same letters in a
 * different order. The program reads each word from a user-specified dictionary
 * file and places the words into a map. The map key is the word with its letters
 * alphabetized, so the key for "staple" is "aelpst", and the key for
 * "petals" is also "aelpst": the two words are anagrams, and all anagrams
 * share the same alphabetized form (or alphagram, as it is sometimes known). The
 * map value is a list containing all of the words that share an alphabetized form.
 * After the dictionary has been processed, each list is a complete anagram group.
 * The program then iterates through the mapâ€™s values() view and prints each
 * list whose size meets the threshold:
 * <p>
 * One step in this program is worthy of note. The insertion of each word into the
 * map, which is shown in bold, uses the computeIfAbsent method, which was
 * added in Java 8. This method looks up a key in the map: If the key is present, the
 * <p>
 * method simply returns the value associated with it. If not, the method computes
 * a value by applying the given function object to the key, associates this value
 * with the key, and returns the computed value. The computeIfAbsent method
 * simplifies the implementation of maps that associate multiple values with each
 * key.
