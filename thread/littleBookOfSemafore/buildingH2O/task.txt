This problem has been a staple of the Operating Systems class at U.C. Berkeley
for at least a decade. It seems to be based on an exercise in Andrews’s
Concurrent Programming [1].
There are two kinds of threads, oxygen and hydrogen. In order to assemble
these threads into water molecules, we have to create a barrier that makes each
thread wait until a complete molecule is ready to proceed.
As each thread passes the barrier, it should invoke bond. You must guarantee
that all the threads from one molecule invoke bond before any of the threads
from the next molecule do.
In other words:
• If an oxygen thread arrives at the barrier when no hydrogen threads are
present, it has to wait for two hydrogen threads.
• If a hydrogen thread arrives at the barrier when no other threads are
present, it has to wait for an oxygen thread and another hydrogen thread.
We don’t have to worry about matching the threads up explicitly; that is,
the threads do not necessarily know which other threads they are paired up
with. The key is just that threads pass the barrier in complete sets; thus, if we
examine the sequence of threads that invoke bond and divide them into groups
of three, each group should contain one oxygen and two hydrogen threads.
Puzzle: Write synchronization code for oxygen and hydrogen molecules that
enforces these constraints.
