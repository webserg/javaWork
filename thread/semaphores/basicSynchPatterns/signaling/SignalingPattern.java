/**
 * User: webserg
 * Date: 18.12.11
 * <p/>
 * Signaling makes it possible to guarantee that a section of code in one thread
 * will run before a section of code in another thread; in other words, it solves the
 * serialization problem.
 * Assume that we have a semaphore named sem with initial value 0, and that
 * Threads A and B have shared access to it.
 * Thread A
 * 1 statement a1
 * 2 sem.signal()
 * Thread B
 * 1 sem.wait()
 * 2 statement b1
 * The word statement represents an arbitrary program statement. To make
 * the example concrete, imagine that a1 reads a line from a file, and b1 displays
 * the line on the screen. The semaphore in this program guarantees that Thread
 * A has completed a1 before Thread B begins b1.
 * Hereâ€™s how it works: if thread B gets to the wait statement first, it will find
 * the initial value, zero, and it will block. Then when Thread A signals, Thread
 * B proceeds.
 * Similarly, if Thread A gets to the signal first then the value of the semaphore
 * will be incremented, and when Thread B gets to the wait, it will proceed immediately.
 * Either way, the order of a1 and b1 is guaranteed.
