/**
 * I am Least Recently Used cache algorithm; I remove the least recently used items first.
 * The one that wasnâ€™t used for a longest time.
 * <p/>
 * I require keeping track of what was used when, which is expensive if one wants to make sure that
 * I always discards the least recently used item.
 * Web browsers use me for caching. New items are placed into the top of the cache.
 * When the cache exceeds its size limit, I will discard items from the bottom. The trick is that whenever an item
 * is accessed, I place at the top.
 * <p/>
 * So items which are frequently accessed tend to stay in the cache. There are two ways to implement
 * me either an array or a linked list (which will have the least recently used entry at the back and the recently
 * used at the front).
 * <p/>
 * I am fast and I am adaptive in other words I can adopt to data access pattern, I have a large family which
 * completes me and they are even better than me (I do feel jealous some times but it is ok)
 * some of my family member are (LRU2 and 2Q) (they were implemented in order to improve LRU caching
