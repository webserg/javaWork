'''Since all the items in a list are really object references, lists, like tuples, can
hold items of any data type, including collection types such as lists and tuples.
Lists can be compared using the standard comparison operators (<, <=, ==, !=, >=,
>), with the comparisons being applied item by item (and recursively for nested
items such as lists or tuples inside lists).
